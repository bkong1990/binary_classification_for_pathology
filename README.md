# binary_classification_for_pathological_images

This is project is the first project of Bin Kong in UNCC

There are different parts:

1 Baseline: SIFT + SVM  ---folder----  baseline

2 DL trained from scratch with data (394 training + 344 testing of 768 * 768)  ---folder--- train_scratch_XF

3 fine tuned DL (394 training + 344 testing of 768 * 768)

4 features extracted from caffenet + SVM

5 DL trained from scratch with more data (7474 training + 4243 testing of 768 * 768)

6 fine tuned DL (7474 training + 4243 testing of 768 * 768)
